# React TODO list

This is a very simple TODO list app built with React. This is my first React project. I am still learning.

## Quick start

To run this web app, you need to have NodeJS installed: https://nodejs.dev/en/

After that, just run these commands in the root folder of the project:

``` bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run web app on localhost
npm run dev
```
